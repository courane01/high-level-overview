	<header class="caption"><h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this lesson you will learn about the basic components that make up WordPress. You will learn a bit about the WordPress ecosystem and take a walk through the WordPress administrative Dashboard. This is also called the back-end. You will get a quick introduction to some jargon and screens that are central to talking about and working with WordPress.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>After going through this lesson, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org.</li>
<li>Locate plugins in the WordPress repository and from their own WordPress administration dashboard.</li>
<li>Locate Themes in the WordPress repository and from their own WordPress administration dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate a WordPress administration dashboard (posts, pages, menus, widgets, user profiles).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisite Skills</h2>
<p>You will be better equipped to work through this lesson if you have experience in and familiarity with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic knowledge of websites and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/high-level-overview/" data-ytta-id="-">content management systems</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Presentation Slides (TBD)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Screening Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever logged into and used a self-hosted WordPress website? (Not WordPress.com)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teacher Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The lesson should alternate between short lectures and live demos. You, as the teacher, need a working local WordPress installation for the demos, as well as an internet connection to demonstrate WordPress.org navigation.</li>
<li>With the exceptions of the exercises, students should not be working on their own sites during lectures and demos. Questions from students will be very specific to their case, so it’s better to plan a period where they can test things on their site and you can answer their questions individually.</li>
<li>Internet access will be needed to demonstrate locating themes, plugins, and support on WordPress.org.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hands-on Walkthrough</h2>
<h3>What is WordPress?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. We like to say that WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time. <cite><a title="WordPress.org" href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">https://wordpress.org/</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong><br />It is often described as a Content Management System as it offers a platform for adding content, such as text, video, images and then managing it. WordPress is often used for building a website. It is open-source free software built by community volunteers. These volunteers test, build, and help identify bugs in the software.  It also allows website owners to manage the content of their website with an easy-to-use interface. It is available to download on WordPress.org for use on a web host server of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong><br />The main website where you can download WordPress for use on your own server. Sites using the software from WordPress.org are often termed "self-hosted" WordPress sites. This hosting may cost money. WordPress.org also hosts the plugin repositories, theme directories, support forums, community volunteer resources, and more resources related to WordPress. Using the WordPress.org software on site allows for custom themes, custom code, ads, and installing plugins to extend functionality.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong><br />This is fully hosted meaning you do not need your own server. Users can select pre-built themes. Many common and popular plugins come with the service so there is no need to install plugins. Users can host a free website through WordPress.com. Custom code and ads are not offered except in limited circumstances.</p>
<h3>Your Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Login</strong><br />The login for your self hosted WordPress site is typically found at the following URL – http://yoursite.com/wp-admin. There are exceptions to this. For example, your WordPress setup maybe installed in a subdirectory.<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-4.08.57-PM.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2368" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-02-at-4.08.57-PM.png" alt="WordPress Login" width="600" height="546" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Dashboard</strong><br />The Dashboard is your administration homepage. It is where you can see different sections of your site.<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/dashboard.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2371" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/dashboard.png" alt="WordPress dashboard" width="600" height="313" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Posts</strong><br />This is where you can create a new post, sometimes referred to as an article. Posts are typically blog entries and are listed here (usually) reverse-chronologically. You can also update your Categories and Post Tags from this administration panel. Categories and Tags are part of the taxonomy, or classification, of a post. You will learn more about <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/user-lessons/categories-vs-tags/" data-ytta-id="-">them here in this lesson</a>.<br /><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/posts1.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2881" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/posts1-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress posts" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Media</strong><br />This is where all your uploaded images, documents or files are stored. The collection of  files stored here are called the Media Library. You can browse through your media library, as well as edit and update the files.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/media.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2882" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/media-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress media" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Pages</strong><br />This is where you create and maintain all your pages. Pages are used for static content that will not change much such as "About Us" or "Contact Us" pages, for example.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-pages.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2883" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-pages-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress pages" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong><br />Comments are when a user writes a response on your site. You can manage all of your comments within this section, including replying to comments or marking them as spam. Spam is an unwanted comment.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Comments.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2884" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Comments-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress Comments" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong><br />This menu is where you control how your site looks. You can choose a new theme, manage your site widgets or menus and even edit your site theme files.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Appearance.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2885" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Appearance-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress Appearance" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong><br />Plugins extend and expand the functionality of WordPress. You can add, activate, deactivate, or delete plugins here.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Plugins.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2886" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Plugins-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress Plugins" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Users</strong><br />This screen lists all the existing users for your site. Depending on your role, you can also add new users as well as manage their roles.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Users.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2887" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-Users-1024x576.png" alt="WordPress Users" width="632" height="356" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Settings</strong><br />This is where the basic settings of your site are configured including your site name and URL, where your posts appear, whether people can leave post comments or not. Most of the time, once your site is setup, there is no need to change any of the settings within this section.<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-General-Settings.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2889" src="https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/WordPress-General-Settings-961x1024.png" alt="WordPress General Settings" width="632" height="673" /></a></p>

<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>One of the things that makes a content management system like WordPress so useful is that you can change the entire look of your site without losing any of the content.  Themes are what determines the look and layout of your website. WordPress.com comes with many pre-built themes while sites that are self-hosted can use themes from directories which contain a listing of themes. One popular directory is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">WordPress Theme Directory</a>. Other themes may be from 3rd Party sites, or sites that are not in the theme directory. One popular 3rd Party theme site is <a href="https://themeforest.net/" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Themeforest</a>.</p>
<p>A <a title="What is a theme" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#What_is_a_Theme.3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">WordPress theme</a> is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. These files are called template files. A theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php). For an introduction to template files, see <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_into_Templates" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Stepping Into Templates</a>.<img class="alignnone wp-image-2690 size-large" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-6.08.12-PM-1024x825.png" alt="WordPress Themes" width="632" height="509" /></p>
<p><strong>Default Themes Demo</strong><br />By default, WordPress comes with a few default themes, such as <a title="Twenty Twelve WordPress Theme" href="https://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Twenty Twelve</a>, <a title="Twenty Thirteen WordPress Theme" href="https://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Twenty Thirteen</a>, <a title="Twenty Fourteen WordPress Theme" href="twentyfourteendemo.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ytta-id="-">Twenty Fourteen</a>, or <a title="Twenty Fifteen WordPress Theme" href="http://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Twenty Fifteen</a>.  Launch these demo sites and give a brief tour.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing Themes</strong><br />To view the themes already installed on your WordPress website, go to Appearances -&gt; Themes <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-7.31.42-PM.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2696" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-7.31.42-PM-1024x540.png" alt="WordPress Dashboard Themes" width="632" height="333" /></a></p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p><a title="Plugins" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Plugins</a> are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already exists in WordPress. For example, can you install a plugin like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">Yoast</a> which helps to improve a site's visibility in Google. Plugins can be found in and downloaded from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" data-external="true" data-ytta-id="-">WordPress Plugin Repository</a>, which contains a listing of many popular plugins.<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.06.08-PM.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2704" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.06.08-PM-1024x863.png" alt="WordPress Plugins" width="632" height="533" /></a> .</p>
<p><strong>Installed Plugins</strong><br />To view the plugins installed on your website, go to Plugins -&gt; Installed. You can add, activate, deactivate, or delete plugins here.<br /><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.22.25-PM.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2706" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.22.25-PM-1024x547.png" alt="Installed Plugins" width="632" height="338" /></a><br /><strong>Enable Hello Dolly</strong><br />Demonstrate enabling Hello Dolly and what this plugin does.<br /><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.25.22-PM.png" data-ytta-id="-"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2708" src="http://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-10-at-8.25.22-PM.png" alt="Hello Dolly enabled" width="502" height="83" /></a></p>
