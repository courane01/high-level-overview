<h2>WordPress Core</h2>
The WordPress core consists of all of the files that make up the WordPress application. These files are placed on a server computer, which may or may not be attached to the Internet. For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that the server is on a hosting service. You can obtain these files in a couple of ways:
<ol>
 	<li>Go to WordPress.org and click the "Download WordPress" button. This will download all of the files bundled together into a single <em>zip file</em>, to your local computer. You will then need to copy this file to your hosting server using either their file management tool or a separate <em>FTP program</em>. Then the zip file needs to be <em>unzipped</em> into the appropriate location on the server for website files.</li>
 	<li>A much easier process is to use the hosting service's one-click install to automatically download the WordPress files, put them in the right place, create a database, and do all of the associated initial site configuration. This process takes you right up to creating your own Administrator account.</li>
</ol>
WordPress is written in a programming language called PHP. That's why many of the core files have the .php <em>file extension</em>. Except in very unusual cases, you should <strong>never edit the core files</strong>. When you want to make changes to the way WordPress behaves, it should be done by editing your site's theme - or preferably <em>child theme</em> - files. How to make these changes goes beyond the scope of this class, but there are more advanced classes that go into it in detail.
<h2><a id="user-content-database" href="https://github.com/wptrainingteam/high-level-overview#database" ></a>Database</h2>
All of the data about your site - including all text content - is stored in a <em>MySQL</em> database. This database is automatically created when you use a one-click install. If you are uploading the core files yourself, you will also need to create this database and enter information about it into a special configuration file, called wp-config.php, in the root directory of your installation. Making changes to this file is one of the few exceptions to the "never edit the core files" rule.

Other than knowing that the database exists, there isn't anything that you need to know to maintain it. If you suspect a problem with your WordPress database and haven't worked with databases before, it's probably best to contact your hosting service's tech support department for assistance.
<h2><a id="user-content-theme" href="https://github.com/wptrainingteam/high-level-overview#theme"  ></a>Theme</h2>
Everything about the way your WordPress site appears in the browser, including its layout, colors, and fonts, is controlled by its theme. There are thousands of themes available around the web, both free and paid. If you're going to use a free theme, I recommend using the official theme repository on WordPress.org. The reason is that all of the themes there have been reviewed against a set of guidelines that include code quality, security, licensing, and documentation. It's unfortunate but true that some free themes that do not come from WordPress.org have been purposely infected with malware or have simply been coded insecurely.

In the theme repository, you can search for themes by color, number of columns, layout, and features. Or you can browse the most popular or newest themes. To use a theme, it must be <em>installed</em> and <em>activated</em>. This is easily done from the Themes menu of WordPress administration area.

Once a theme is activated, it may include features such as changing colors or layouts. The documentation for the theme will describe all of these options. There's nothing wrong with trying out as many themes as you like before settling on the best one for your site.

There is an also subset of themes known as child themes. A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality of another theme, called the <em>parent theme</em>. Child themes allow you to modify or add to the functionality of the parent. A child theme can be created from any theme and using one will prevent changes that you make from being lost if you update the parent theme.

If you're using a child theme, note that both the child and parent themes need to be installed, but that only the child will be activated.
<h2><a id="user-content-plugins" href="https://github.com/wptrainingteam/high-level-overview#plugins"  ></a>Plugins</h2>
If themes control how your site looks, plugins control what it does. Plugins are software modules that work with the WordPress core to make your site do everything from e-commerce to photo slideshows.

As with themes, the best place to find free plugins is in the WordPress.org plugin repository. You can search for the type of plugin that you're looking for and read descriptions and reviews of those available. A few suggestions on selecting plugins:
<ul>
 	<li>Look for those with large numbers of positive reviews, downloads, and ratings. A plugin with a 5-star rating and 100 downloads may not be as good as a one with a 4-star rating and 100,000 downloads.</li>
 	<li>Look for those that are compatible with the current version of WordPress and have a recent "last updated" date. That indicates that the plugin is under active development.</li>
 	<li>Click the "Support" link and see what kind of problems users are reporting. All software has bugs, but make sure that the plugin you are planning to use isn't crippled by them.</li>
</ul>
Some plugins are built on a <em>freemium</em> model. This means that a basic version of the plugin is provided for free, but that more advanced or add-on features are available for a fee. Make sure that you read the descriptions carefully to see what, if any, paid features you will want to use. And like themes, you can always try out multiple plugins before settling on one that best meets your needs.


<h2><a href="https://github.com/wptrainingteam/high-level-overview#domains"  ></a>Domains</h2>
To host your own WordPress site, you will need a <em>domain name</em>. These are the unique names that end in .com, .org, .net, or any of the other available extensions. These extensions are actually called <em>top level domains</em> (<em>TLD)</em>. Domains are registered and managed through companies called <em>domain registrars</em>.

Every domain name must be unique, which is why it can be so hard to find one that is short and memorable in the most common TLDs. Recently, a whole slew of new TLDs have been created including .computer, .dating, .gift, and yes, .pizza. Most people try and stick with .com, especially for a business, because it is what people are most used to and find easiest to remember.

Once you find an available domain name, you will need to register it. During this process, you will be asked to designate four contacts: Registrant, Admin, Technical, and Billing. These can all be the same person or different people. Registrant and Admin are the most important, because they have the most control over the domain registration record and the approval process for how the domain is used.

The other important setting in the domain registration is for the <em>nameservers</em> used by the domain. Nameservers are computers on the Internet that act like address books, mapping domain names to the address of computers that host services like websites and email. When you first register a name, it will use the nameserver of the domain registrar itself. At this point, if you type the domain name into a browser, you'll probably get a "this page under construction" page, branded with the registrar's name and logo.

If the company you've registered with is also your web hosting company, you may not need to change the nameservers. However, if the companies are different, you will need to change the nameservers (there are always at least 2 of them for redundancy) to those of the company where your WordPress site is hosted.

Make sure that you write down the account access information for your domain registrar. Because the information there tends to be of the set-and-forget type, people often lose track of their username and password, or change email address without updating it at the registrar. Eventually, you'll need to log back into this account and there's nothing more frustrating than trying to retrieve the password for an account that was set up by someone whose email address no longer exists.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/wptrainingteam/high-level-overview#web-hosting"  ></a>Web Hosting</h2>
Web hosting companies provide space on their computers for the files and databases that make up most websites, including your WordPress site. These computers are usually located in large data centers with multiple power sources and large networks connecting them to the Internet.

There are two main types of hosting services: <em>shared hosting</em> and <em>dedicated hosting</em>. Shared hosting is the most common configuration since it is the least expensive, and means that you share computer hardware with many other websites but that all of these sites are all kept separate by special software. No one is able to access anyone else's site. Each shared hosting account has its own <em>control panel</em> that lets you control various aspects of your site. This is where the "one-click install" for WordPress is found, provided that the hosting company offers it.

Dedicated hosting means that your website is hosted on a computer that has the sole function of hosting your website. With a dedicated server, you do not share hardware with other websites.

When selecting a web hosting company, it's a good idea to go online and look for reviews about the different companies. You want to choose one that's in your price range but that also has a good reputation for customer service and performance.

Once you have a web host with WordPress installed and a domain name that is pointed to the host's nameservers, you're online! You can then move on to the actual business of setting up your self-hosted WordPress site.
